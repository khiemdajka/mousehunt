## 1. Know what to expect
- How high can I climb with all UC?
- How good the result is compared to other options?
- How much time and resources do I need to pour in to make it happen?
- Do I really want to do this?

The first two questions can be answered by using the chart below, while you can refer to UC Farming Guide in [References](#5-references) section for the third question. The last question can only be answered by yourself.

## 2. Requirements
- Before the run:
    - 1000 Tower Sigils
    - 75 Fragments of the Eclipse
    - 1500 Tower Secrets
- During the run:
    - 1000 Gauntlet String Cheese
    - 500 Ultimate Charm
    - 1000 Champion's Fire (the run itself will refund 500+ CF from poking Unstable Rift Cores, so only 500 CF spent)

Average UC needed: **475** Ultimate Charm

## 3. Popular plan
- Step 1: Farm Ultimate Potion during Halloween(s)
- Step 2: Farm Plumepearl Herbs and Lunaria Petal during GWH
- Step 3: Farm Twisted Carmine for essence after GWH (can farm during LNY as well)
- Step 4: Push with UC

## 4. Using the simulators
### 4.1. Simulators
- [Aaron's sim](https://tinyurl.com/VRift): for checing the median run
- [Re's sim (modified)](https://bit.ly/MH_Re_Vrift_sim_mod): for checking probability to reach a certain TE
### 4.2. Comparing run performance
(in other words, *how am I doing?*)
- Change that question to: ***What is the probability to reach <that_position> (floor/step) with <that_number_of_hunts> or less?***
- Tool: [Re's sim (modified)](https://bit.ly/MH_Re_Vrift_sim_mod)
- Checking current progress at a certain TE:
    - On `Sim` sheet, input `Step` = 0, `Sync` = <number_of_hunts_done>, `Siphon` = 0 *(for example, I reached TE2 in 20 hunts so I put 0/20/0 there)*
    - Check `At least` column of that TE *(9.9% for me here)*
- Checking current progress at the start of a customed floor:
    - Same as above, except that you should check `At least` column of that particular floor
- Usage: planning retreat (or making the break point of *I will retreat if I can't reach TEx by y hunts*)
    - On `Sim` sheet, input `Step` = 0 and `Siphon` = 0
    - Track the change of `At least` value at your make-it-or-break-it TEx (x can be any number between 2 and 6)
    - Decide the threshold you're comfortable with *(mine is 10%)* and check the target hunt count *(mine is 20 hunts to TE2 (9.9%) or 38 hunts to TE3 (8.6%))*
    - Stick to the plan

## 5. Considerations
- You can do your climb in parts, since no aura/event boost needed for the actual climb. Even without having enough UC, starting to get your PB stats higher helps speeding up the UC farming process (i.e. minluck Twisted Carmine with lesser charm and fewer auras)
- 300-400 UC is a good point to start. It takes about 600 hunts to reach TE14 and about 850 hunts to reach TE17, and those 2 are the checkpoints that helps minlucking TC easier. You can always farm more UC later.

## Extension: Retreat strategy

While the climb can be simple as "arm your best setup, turn CF on, and widget hunt for 10 days straight", some of us want to have the best start (when TA AR is still as high as 18.3%) instead of relying on that 8% AR on final laps. That is why this strategy exists.
This can be done with either UC or your best non-UC setup. The choice of this will affect other parts of the decision making process a lot.

Before starting, check the tables to get yourself familiar with the expectations of cost of time and resources of doing retreat.\
![Retreat threshold](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/869153158335713300/1037538395133575188/unknown.png)

Then you can do the steps below.

***Step 1:*** Based on the charts, ***choose a certain aim*** you're comfortable with the expected resource burned.
- Note the expected usage of charm, CF, Fragments, and Secrets. You should be well aware of the amount of time and resource pouring to doing this strategy and thus see the big picture before making the decision.\
*(If you're still not aware yet, then I'll tell you again: Retreat strategy is the next-level whaling, like 1.5x UC push, and it may not even work for you. Think carefully before you start. But if you do decide to do it, I'm here cheering and praying for you.)*

***Step 2: Farm Fragments and Secrets***
- For retreating with UC, you can farm enough Fragments and Secrets for **1** climb then start testing the water.
- For retreating with non-UC setups, it's recommended to farm enough Fragments and Secrets for multiple climbs and fit those climbs to a certain aura span. Common span is 7 days (1 Cursed Skull worth of Spooky Aura), which can hold as many as 20 climbs depending on your chosen aim. Also consider the expected number of retreat for this step. For example, if you expect to do 20 climbs and are willing use use 4 Cursed Skull then it's fine to farm Fragments and Secrets for 5-7 climbs then start climbing.

***Step 3: Climb!***
- Start the climb with **Super Siphon** + **Ultimate Umbra** + **String Stepping** augmentations. All other augmentations are optional, except for **Elixir Rain** which should not be activate, to save Secrets.
- Retreat if the chance of reaching the ***aim*** drops to ***0%***.
- In case you have more than 1 checkpoints *(like me, I believe in second chances)*, retreat if the chance of all the aims drop to 0%.
- If you achieve the ***aim***, turn off your brain and commit to the run. Don't forget to pray in <#398846322154799104> every once in a while ðŸ˜‰
