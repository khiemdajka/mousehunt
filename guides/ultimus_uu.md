## 1. Requirements
- Before the run:
    - 1000 Tower Sigils
    - 75 Fragments of the Eclipse
    - 1500 Tower Secrets
- During the run:
    - 1000 Gauntlet String Cheese
    - 500 Ultimate Charm
    - 1000 Champion's Fire (the run itself will refund 500+ CF from poking Unstable Rift Cores, so only 500 CF spent)

Average UC needed: **475** Ultimate Charm

## 2. Popular plan
- Step 1: Farm Ultimate Potion during Halloween(s)
- Step 2: Farm Plumepearl Herbs and Lunaria Petal during GWH
- Step 3: Farm Twisted Carmine for essence after GWH (can farm during LNY as well)
- Step 4: Push with UC

## 3. Using the simulators
- Checking the median run: [Aaron's sim](https://tinyurl.com/VRift)
- Checking probability to reach a certain TE: [Re's sim (modified)](https://bit.ly/MH_Re_Vrift_sim_mod)
- [Comparing run performance](https://discord.com/channels/275500976662773761/930851824234274816/1036336532166029352)

## 4. Considerations
- You can do your climb in parts, since no aura/event boost needed for the actual climb. Even without having enough UC, starting to get your PB stats higher helps speeding up the UC farming process (i.e. minluck Twisted Carmine with lesser charm and fewer auras)
- 300-400 UC is a good point to start. It takes about 600 hunts to reach TE14 and about 850 hunts to reach TE17, and those 2 are the checkpoints that helps minlucking TC easier. You can always farm more UC later.
